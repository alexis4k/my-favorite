                <p> My hobby is singing and playing the piano at the same time. I usually like singing popular pop songs and hits or playing classical music on the piano and singing along. Whenever i have some free time i just open up lyrics to a song that i like and sing, good or bad. Singing is something i really like and i also have a teacher who helps me with it. I also sometimes challenge myself to sing highpitched songs and see how it will turn out. Hopefully, someday, i will become really good at singing and playing the piano.
